        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The Core Principle: Proportional Distribution</h2>
        <p>This is the heart of the PAMM system. All transactions and results are distributed on a proportional basis.
            If an investor's capital makes up 10% of the total pool, they will receive exactly 10% of the profits (or
            incur 10% of the losses) from any trade. This automated process ensures fairness and transparency for
            everyone involved.</p>
