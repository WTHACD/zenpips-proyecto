        <div class="prose">
            <p>Understanding the mechanics of a PAMM account is straightforward. It involves three key players: the
                <strong>Investor(s)</strong>, the <strong>Trader/Manager</strong>, and the <strong>Broker</strong>.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Investment:</strong> Investors choose a manager and invest a certain amount of capital into
                    the manager's PAMM account. This creates a pooled fund.</li>
                <li><strong>Trading:</strong> The manager uses the total pooled funds to execute trades on the forex
                    market. The manager does not have access to withdraw the investors' funds, only to trade with them.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Profit/Loss Distribution:</strong> All profits or losses generated by the manager's trading
                    activity are automatically distributed among the manager and all investors, proportional to their
                    share in the account.</li>
            </ol>
